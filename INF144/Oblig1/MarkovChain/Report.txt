0th approximation
In order to run the zeroth approximation markov chain you need the files:
Folktale.txt
MarkovZeroth.java

Run these commands:
javac MarkovZeroth.java
java MarkovZeroth


1st, 2nd, and 3rd approximation
The text is generated from MarkovOblig, when run with the parameters 1, 2, or 3 it will
generate text with the corresponding approximation of the Markov model
You will then be asked to provide a starting state: the length of this will need to
match the appropriate approximation.

In order to run the first approximation markov chain, you need the files;
Folktale.txt
MarkovModel.java
MarkovOblig.java
Bag.java

These commands would work for a 3rd approximation:
javac MarkovOblig.java
java MarkovOblig 3
